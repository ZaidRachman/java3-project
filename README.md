# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a 
journal of all the things I learned throughout the class

## Chapters 1 and 2

In chapters 1 and 2 we learned about Java EE and Multi-Tiered Applications.
Java EE, or Java Enterprise Edition, describes how web servers can collaborate
with Java web technologies such as JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Servlets.
We learned about Servlets and how they handle the HTTP request and response processing
for dynamic web page content. We also went over the concept of Multi-Tiered applications
and how each interact with each other. More specifically, we went over how the Client, Server, 
and Data connect together to create a web application.
